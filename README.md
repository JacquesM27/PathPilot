## My Story

I have always felt that something was missing in trip planning. Every approach seemed complicated, and the end result never turned out as expected. From choosing attractions to finding the right accommodations, the planning process has been difficult and time-consuming.

With PathPilot, this situation will change. Now, with PathPilot, trip planning will become simpler and more satisfying. It will help me manage my trips efficiently, allowing me to focus on the journey itself and creating unforgettable memories.


## Event Storming Session
